An assignment I had to make after following with the lessons provided in 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro by Dr. Angela Yu .

## About this Project
A script based game of the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors where the player decide between 3 choices and goes against the computer's random selection of the same 3 choices too and see who can win.
